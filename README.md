# Churn Prediction using Random Forest

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a Random Forest classifier. The dataset used contains information about customers, including their credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, and whether they have exited the bank. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave the bank (churn) based on these features.

 


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is Churn_Modelling.csv, which contains the following columns:

RowNumber: Unique identifier for each row.

CustomerId: Unique identifier for each customer.

Surname: Customer's last name.

CreditScore: Customer's credit score.

Geography: Country of the customer.

Gender: Gender of the customer.

Age: Age of the customer.

Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.

Balance: Balance in the customer's account.

NumOfProducts: Number of bank products the customer uses.

HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the customer.

Exited: Whether the customer has exited the bank (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
